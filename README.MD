# Still looking for a name !!
When you watch many episodes of a long series of movies or tv shows or you read tons of books of a novel series, and after a long period the producers of that series release a new season but you almost forgot what happened in previous seasons. This application will give you a recap and help you to remember what happened in the older seasons üåü.

**NOTE:**
This application still under development and I will push commits frequently, so please don't do a pull request, I won't accept it. Although I accept names suggestions for the application ‚ò∫Ô∏è
